## ðŸŒ± **Welcome to the Garden Wiki!**

This is my hub for accessing short notes, thoughts, quotes and even cheatsheets. Inspired by Einstein's famous question: *"Why should I memorize something I can so easily get from BOOK?"*, but some books are too long, so I'd rather write my own summaries to consult :D

In addition, I'm greatly inspired by Tiago Forte and his [*Building a Second Brain*](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/), organizing my ideas to make my life easier and that of those who want to learn and update themselves. The idea is to combine the best of both worlds: a traditional wiki with cheatsheets that help give you that boost when it comes to consulting essential information.

The "gwiki" logo was supposed to be a variation of my name, but it ended up becoming a pun that combines **Garden** and **Wiki**, representing this environment where knowledge grows in a disorganized way and a freer environment like a garden.

## ðŸš€ **Explore, connect and enjoy!**
